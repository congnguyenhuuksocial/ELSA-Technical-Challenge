    - The Quiz Joining Service validates the quiz ID and adds the user to the Quiz Session.
    - The system triggers the `UserJoinedQuizSession` event.
    - Multiple users can join the session concurrently, managed by the Concurrent User Handling Service, which ensures data consistency and triggers `MultipleUsersJoinedQuizSession`.

2. **Real-Time Score Updates:**
    - As users submit their answers, the Score Updating Service processes these answers.
    - The user's score is calculated and updated in real-time.
    - The system triggers the `ScoreUpdated` event to reflect this change.
    - The Scoring Accuracy Service continuously validates the scores to ensure accuracy and consistency, triggering `ScoreConsistencyChecked` events as needed.

3. **Real-Time Leaderboard:**
    - The Leaderboard Display Service queries the current scores and displays the standings.
    - Whenever a score changes, the Leaderboard Update Service updates the leaderboard in real-time.
    - The system triggers `LeaderboardUpdated` and `LeaderboardScoreChanged` events to ensure the display is current and accurate.

### Conclusion

This detailed analysis provides a comprehensive view of how the acceptance criteria can be modeled using Domain-Driven Design principles. It includes a clear breakdown of domain concepts, entities, services, aggregates, and domain events, ensuring that the system is both robust and maintainable.

# Database design
---
To design the database for the quiz application, we will create tables that represent the core entities: users, quiz sessions, answers, scores, and the leaderboard. Below is the SQL code to create these tables, along with their relationships.

### Database Schema

```sql
-- Users table to store user information
CREATE TABLE Users (
    ID VARCHAR(36) PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    SessionID VARCHAR(36)
);

-- QuizSessions table to store quiz session information
CREATE TABLE QuizSessions (
    SessionID VARCHAR(36) PRIMARY KEY,
    QuizID VARCHAR(36) NOT NULL,
    Participants TEXT -- Could be a JSON array of user IDs
);

-- Answers table to store user answers
CREATE TABLE Answers (
    AnswerID VARCHAR(36) PRIMARY KEY,
    UserID VARCHAR(36) NOT NULL,
    QuestionID VARCHAR(36) NOT NULL,
    Answer TEXT NOT NULL,
    Timestamp TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (UserID) REFERENCES Users(ID)
);

-- Scores table to store user scores
CREATE TABLE Scores (
    ScoreID VARCHAR(36) PRIMARY KEY,
    UserID VARCHAR(36) NOT NULL,
    Points INT NOT NULL,
    Timestamp TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (UserID) REFERENCES Users(ID)
);

-- Leaderboard table to store the leaderboard standings
CREATE TABLE Leaderboard (
    LeaderboardID VARCHAR(36) PRIMARY KEY,
    SessionID VARCHAR(36) NOT NULL,
    UserID VARCHAR(36) NOT NULL,
    Rank INT NOT NULL,
    Points INT NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (SessionID) REFERENCES QuizSessions(SessionID),
    FOREIGN KEY (UserID) REFERENCES Users(ID)
);
```

### Explanation of the Tables

1. **Users Table**
    - **ID**: Unique identifier for each user.
    - **Name**: The name of the user.
    - **SessionID**: The ID of the session the user is participating in (nullable, as the user may not always be in a session).

2. **QuizSessions Table**
    - **SessionID**: Unique identifier for each quiz session.
    - **QuizID**: Identifier for the quiz.
    - **Participants**: A text field (or JSON) containing the IDs of users participating in the session.

3. **Answers Table**
    - **AnswerID**: Unique identifier for each answer.
    - **UserID**: The ID of the user who submitted the answer.
    - **QuestionID**: The ID of the question being answered.
    - **Answer**: The actual answer text.
    - **Timestamp**: The time when the answer was submitted.

4. **Scores Table**
    - **ScoreID**: Unique identifier for each score entry.
    - **UserID**: The ID of the user to whom the score belongs.
    - **Points**: The score points.
    - **Timestamp**: The time when the score was recorded.

5. **Leaderboard Table**
    - **LeaderboardID**: Unique identifier for each leaderboard entry.
    - **SessionID**: The ID of the session to which the leaderboard belongs.
    - **UserID**: The ID of the user.
    - **Rank**: The rank of the user in the leaderboard.
    - **Points**: The points scored by the user.

### Indexes

To optimize the performance of the database, especially for queries that are frequently executed, we can add indexes:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_users_sessionid ON Users (SessionID);
CREATE INDEX idx_answers_userid ON Answers (UserID);
CREATE INDEX idx_scores_userid ON Scores (UserID);
CREATE INDEX idx_leaderboard_sessionid ON Leaderboard (SessionID);
CREATE INDEX idx_leaderboard_userid ON Leaderboard (UserID);
```

### Relationships and Foreign Keys

The foreign key constraints ensure referential integrity:

- `Answers` table references the `Users` table through `UserID`.
- `Scores` table references the `Users` table through `UserID`.
- `Leaderboard` table references the `QuizSessions` table through `SessionID` and the `Users` table through `UserID`.

This database schema design ensures the core entities are well-defined and their relationships are maintained, which aligns with the requirements of the quiz application.
